## Description
Duration: 2 Week Sprint

Color is a critical tool for artists and designers. We are surrounded by interesting color combinations all of the time. For example, I might notice a cool color combination in a pattern on someone's shirt or displayed on a package logo or in a piece of artwork. I might go for a walk and see a striking scene in nature with a great color palette. Color inspirations are everywhere but if you don’t have a way to record and save them, then you don’t remember them. 

My app will generate color palettes from photos that users upload. The idea is a user will upload a photo and the app will generate the prominent colors in the photo so that the user can store and access the palette later on.

It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example -- Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the .env file.

Create a database named your database name,
The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly.
